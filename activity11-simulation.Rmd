## The Central Limit Theorem

From your introductory statistics course, recall that the **Central Limit Theorem** tells us about the distribution of a sample mean, which is called the sampling distribution.
As sample size becomes sufficiently large, the sampling distribution approaches a normal distribution and the standard deviation of the sampling distribution decreases. 

In this activity, we will explore these findings with a statistical simulations.
**For this activity, we will use a seed of 518.**

```{r global-options, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error = TRUE)
set.seed(518)
```

Note that when you knit your report, your results will always be the same; however, if you re-run code chunks individually, they use different seeds.
One way to make sure that you get similar results each time is to always run all previous code chunks ![run all chunks above icon](README-img/run-above-icon.png) before running the current code chunk ![run current chunk icon](README-img/run-current-icon.png).


## Set-up

For this activity, you will need the `{tidyverse}`.

```{r loadtidy}
library(tidyverse)
```


## Exploration

### Normally distributed population

Below I generate 1,000 samples from a Normally distributed random variable with a mean 50 and standard deviation 10 and constructed a *histogram* and overlay a line for the distribution.

```{r norm-samp}
norm_samp_1000 <- tibble(
  values = rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 50, sd = 10)
)

ggplot(norm_samp_1000, aes(x = values)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..count.. / sum(..count..)),       # plot proportion instead of count
                 fill = "white",
                 color = "black",
                 binwidth = 3) +                            # specify how big bins should be
  stat_function(fun = function(x)                           # some rescaling "magic" to get correct densities
                      dnorm(x, mean = 50, sd = 10) * 3,     # see: https://stackoverflow.com/a/36344354
                color = "#0065a4",                          # laker-blue is #0065a4
                size = 2,                                   # make line a little thicker
                alpha = 0.4) +                                
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(norm_samp_1000$values),      # plot vline at mean of sample
             color = "#a43f00",                             # pick a color to contrast blue
             size = 2) +
  theme_minimal() +                                         # get ride of chart junk
  labs(y = "proportion")                                    # rename y axis

```

Using `norm_samp_1000`, obtain the mean and standard deviation of this sample?

```{r MeanStd}
MeanStd <- norm_samp_1000 %>%
 summarize(mean=mean(values),stdev=sd(values))
view(MeanStd)
```

**RESPONSE**: I have the mean being 50.19228 and the standard deviation at 9.59245.

Now, create a new simulation.
In this you will obtain a sample of size 30 from from a Normally distributed variable with a mean 50 and standard deviation 10, and find the mean and standard deviation.
How do the mean and standard deviation compare to your answers above?

```{r SimSamp30}
norm_samp_30 <- tibble(
  values = rnorm(n = 30, mean = 50, sd = 10)
)
MeanStd2 <- norm_samp_30 %>%
 summarize(mean=mean(values),stdev=sd(values))
view(MeanStd2)
```
**Response**: In this sampling, I got the mean at 	47.78609 and the standard deviation
at 9.87055. This is somewhat similar to what the 1000 samples were.

### Non-normally distributed population

Using a similar process, obtain Exponentially distributed variable (`?rexp`) with a *rate* of 0.02.
Obtain a sample of 1,000 observations and a sample of 30 observations.
Then, calculate the mean and standard deviation of each sample and discuss how the values are similar and how they differ.

```{r SimExp1000}
exp_samp_1000 <- tibble(
  values = rexp(n = 1000, rate = 0.02)
)
exp_samp_30 <- tibble(
  values = rexp(n = 30, rate = 0.02)
)
MeanStd3 <- exp_samp_1000 %>%
 summarize(mean1000=mean(values),stdev1000=sd(values))
view(MeanStd3)
MeanStd4 <- exp_samp_30 %>%
 summarize(mean30=mean(values),stdev30=sd(values))
view(MeanStd4)
```

**Response**: For the 1000 samples, the mean was 50.24338 and the standard deviation
is 51.45936. For the 30 samples, the mean=42.08908 and standard deviation=31.20613. For
the 30 samples, the standard deviation is tighter and the mean was lower. As the sample
simulated increased the width of the distribution and increased the number of extreem 
values.

## Many distributions

We previously looked at one distribution at a time.
It would be nice to explore multiple distributions simulataneouly.
To do this, we will create a new function.
Yay!

Write a function (say, `generate_n_samples`) that takes `n` (how many values to sample) as its argument.
This function should produce a dataset containing four columns: one that generates data from a **Normal** distribution (parameters mean and standard deviation), one from a **Exponential** distribution (parameter rate), one from a **Chi-square** distribution` (parameter degrees of freedom), and one from a **Uniform** distribution (parameters minimum and maximum).
This function should produce a dataset with `n` rows.

You should **not** use the default parameter options for these distributions (e.g., your Normal data should not have a mean of 0 or a standard deviation of 1).
Test your function with `n = 30` and `n = 1000`.

```{r function}
generate_n_samples <- function(num){
  Normal_Dist <- rnorm(n = num, mean = 50, sd = 10)
  Exponential_Dist <- rexp(n = num, rate = 0.02)
  ChiSquare_Dist <- rchisq(num, 10)
  Uniform_Dist <- dunif(num, min=0, max=1)
  
  alldist = data.frame(Normal_Dist,Exponential_Dist,ChiSquare_Dist,Uniform_Dist)
  
  View(alldist)
}
#test
generate_n_samples(100)
```


Keep the following information in mind for the rest of this activity.
The mean and standard deviation for each of the general distributions we are using in this activity are (using the R function arguments):

- [Normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution): mean = `mean`, standard deviation = `sd`
- [Exponential distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution): mean = 1 / `rate`, standard deviation = 1 / `rate`
- [Chi-square distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_distribution): mean = `df`, standard deviation = sqrt(2 * `df`)
- [Uniform distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_uniform_distribution): (`min` + `max`) / 2, standard deviation = (`max` - `min`) / sqrt(12)


Complete the table below with the **mean and standard deviation** values for your specific distributions.
These are the "population values".

| Distribution | Mean       | SD         |
|--------------|------------|------------|
| Normal       |    50      |     10     |
| Exponential  |    50      |     50     |
| Chi-square   |    10      |     4.47   |
| Uniform      |    0.5     |    0.29    |


Below I provide you with a function that calculates the sample mean for each column/distribution.

```{r sample_mean}
sample_mean <- function(.data){
  .data %>% 
    summarise(across(everything(), mean, .names = "mean_{.col}"))
}
```

First, verify that you know what each line of this function is doing.
Then, use this function in addition to your multiple distribution sample generator from above to calculate the means for `n = 30` and `n = 1000`
Discuss how the means compares for each distribution.
Note that it doesn't make sense to compare means/standard deviations across the distributions.


```{r Nested Functions}
generate_n_samples(30)
sample_mean(alldist)
```


## Many samples

We previously looked at taking one sample at a time.
To explore the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), we need to generate multiple samples.
The `BASE::replicate`, `purrr::rerun`, or `purr::map_*` functions are convenient ways to generate multiple samples of data.

```
# Each of these generate 1,000 samples of n = 30 from a normal(mean = 50, sd = 10)

# BASE::replicate()
## simplify = FALSE keeps the results as a list 
## rather than coercing them to an array/matrix
replicate(1000, rnorm(30, mean = 50, sd = 10), simplify = FALSE)

# purrr::rerun
rerun(1000, rnorm(30, mean = 50, sd = 10))

# This could also be done in purr::map 
map(1:1000, ~rnorm(30, mean = 50, sd = 10))
```

Continuing to work with your multiple distribution sample generator from above, generate 1,000 samples from the four distributions each with size 30.
We will want to continue to work with this list so be sure to assign these samples to an appropriately named object (say, `multiple_samples`).



Calculate the sample mean of each sample using the appropriate `map` function and my `sample_mean` function to produce a *data frame* of multiple sample means from your multiple samples object.
Assign these sample means to an appropriately named object.





Restructure your previous sample means R object to, instead of having 1,000 rows and 4 columns, have 4,000 rows and 2 columns where the columns are named `distribution` and `means`.
Assign this restructured data to an appropriately named object.




Using the restructured data, create a histogram for each `distribution` using a *facet* layer.




Comment on each of shape of each of the mean plots above.
How was the distribution of the sample means different than the distribution of the population?
Note, looking at the wiki pages linked early in this activity will help you compare your sample mean distributions to the population distributions.



Using the restructured data, obtain the mean and standard deviation **for each** of the distributions.




Comment on how each mean compares to the "population values" mean that you calculated above.



Comment on how each standard deviation compares to the "population values" standard deviation that you calculated above.

## Larger sample size

You previously explored how the distribution of sample means for `n = 30` behaves for four specific distributions.
Now, I will do this for `n = 100`.
Update the parameter arguments in `distribution_exploration` with the values that you have been working with.
You can explore my quickly-assembled function if you are interested.
After you run the code below, be sure to click through the different viewer windows to see the plots and summary tables.
The first view widow should simply tell you "`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`."

```{r}
source(here::here("functions", "helper.R"))

distribution_exploration(n = 100, rep = 1000, mean = 50, sd = 10, rate = 0.2, df = 4, min = 20, max = 40)
```


How do these values compare to your work with `n = 30`?





### Challenge 1

Hopefully, this version of the CLT seems like a refresher.
However, it would be nice to see if this holds for other statistics?
Instead of calculating the mean of each of the 1,000 samples, explore one or a few (or all) of the following summary statistics:

- median
- midhinge
- maximum
- standard deviation
- IQR



## Challenge 2: Apply this knowledge

GVSU claims that the Laker Line bus route has a 10 minute wait time during the peak hours of 7 am - 9 pm (https://www.gvsu.edu/bus/bus-route-ll-gvsu-laker-line-weekday-69.htm).
Assume that wait times are Exponentially distributed with a mean of 10 minutes.
For Exponentially distributed variables, remember that mean = 1 / `rate`.
What is the `rate` of our population distribution?


You think this might be a lie.
In the last 30 days during peak hours, you have waited for the bus an average of 15 minutes.

If the bus system is telling the truth, how unlucky have you been this past month?
You will make an argument both by direct simulation and using the CLT.
(*Hint for CLT, i.e., z-score, method: remember that the sd is equal to the mean.*)

### Using simulation

To do this, 

1. Simulate 30 random values (a sample of 30 days) from the appropriate exponential distribution.
2. Do (1), 1,000 times
3. Calculate the mean of each of the 1,000 samples
4. Calculate what percentage of the sample means waited as long or longer than you.




### Using CLT

To do this,

1. Recall that the CLT states that all potential sample means are approximately normal with mean 10 (GVSU's claim) and a standard deviation of the population standard deviation (you calculated this by-hand above) divided by the square root of the sample size (30 days).
2. Find the probability from the normal distribution in (1) that a sample mean is as long as or longer than your time of 15 minutes. You do not need to use any simulations, simply the appropriate `xnorm` function (where `x` is replaced with the appropriate one of either `d`, `p`, `q`, or `r`).





Comment on how similar/different your results were for the simulation and CLT methods.



Do you believe that bus wait times are Exponentially distributed?
